document.getElementById("pa1").innerHTML = "I'm a second-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in software development, web technologies, and problem-solving through code. Over the past two years, I've built a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, and JavaScript, and I've worked on a variety of academic and personal projects that have helped me develop practical skills in both front-end and back-end development. Outside of coursework, I actively seek out opportunities to learn new tools and frameworks, participate in coding challenges, and collaborate with others on creative projects.";
document.getElementById("pa2").innerHTML = "I worked as a data encoder for Tutok Politika K5 News FM during the midterm elections, where I was responsible for handling large volumes of sensitive election data with accuracy and efficiency. I also participated as a designer in a Toon Boom workshop, where I explored the fundamentals of digital animation and design, further expanding my creative thinking and proficiency with visual tools. I also served as a board member for the Programmers' Guild at my university, where I help organize events, mentor peers, and promote a strong coding community through collaborative learning. One of my most fulfilling projects was designing a Figma prototype for an app called Zenspace, a mental wellness app focused on helping individuals manage stress and anxiety through guided meditation.";
